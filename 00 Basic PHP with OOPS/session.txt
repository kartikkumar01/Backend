session is the time when user came and goes from the website.

Managing session means to know the user at each request he is using the website.

session_start(); -> creates new session or fetch the existing session

unset($_SESSION['loggedIn']); -> unset session variable

session_unset(); -> unset all session variables
session_destroy(); -> destroys the session

echo session_id(); // Get session ID
session_regenerate_id(true); // Generate new ID (recommended after login)

If the user hasnâ€™t made a server request for a long time, you consider them inactive and log them out.

sessions expires either done explicitly using session_destroy or when user closes the browser.
